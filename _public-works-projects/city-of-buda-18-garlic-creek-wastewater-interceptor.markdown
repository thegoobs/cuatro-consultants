The Garlic Creek Wastewater Interceptor was designed to serve the Garlic Creek watershed upstream of the City of Buda.  Cuatro Consultants assisted the City in identifying old project plans and updating the design route through the Cullen Country and Garlic Creek developments.

The first segment of construction through Cullen Country included approximately 2,000 linear feet of 18” gravity PVC, F679 main.  The Project also included 10 manholes, approximately 60 feet of 24 steel casing in highway bore, various easements and right-of-way acquisition.  The first segment crossed Garlic Creek.  The Project was completed in 2003.

This project replaced various small water mains with a new 12 inch water main.  This rehabilitative project consisted of installing 2,515 linear feet of 12 inch PVC water main, gate valves, wet connections and fire hydrants to offer improved fire flow service to existing businesses and the new Mira Vista office complex along Bee Caves Road.  All wet connections were scheduled at night since the existing water system had to be shut down.  Project required extensive coordination with the City of Rollingwood and existing commercial development along Bee Caves Road.  The Project was completed in July 2002.

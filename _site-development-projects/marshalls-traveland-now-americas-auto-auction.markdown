Complete site permit development design of this new RV Sales and Service Center on the east side of IH-35 near Buda.  The Project includes approximately 27,100 square yards of base and pavement drive and parking areas.  The building is 25,000 square feet.  The Project includes 3,485 linear feet of 4-inch water line, two detention ponds, an on-site sewage facility, and a vehicle wash station with water reclamation unit.  This project required City of Buda, Hays County, and TxDOT approval.  Cuatro assisted the Owner in negotiating a wastewater line extension to serve this tract and adjoining acreage.  Similarly, the Project required a Goforth SUD water line extension to provide potable water. 

This Marshall's Travelland site in Buda was redeveloped as the regional sales auction for America's Auto Auction in 2010.
